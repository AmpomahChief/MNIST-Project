        This project(MNIST project) was about building a machine learning model that classifies handwritten digits given handwritten images. The MNIST dataset is a set of 70,000 small images of numbers handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. Each print is labelled with the digit it represents.

        This project followed the CRISP-DM framework, which involves;

        1. Business Understanding
        2. Data Understanding
        3. Data Preparation
        4. Modeling 
        5. Evaluation
        6. Deployment

        For this project, the Modeling phase was split into two parts. The first part was to train a model to predict one digit – for example, the number 5. This “5-detector” is an example of a binary classifier, capable of distinguishing between two classes, 5 and not-5. 

        The second part explored multiclass classifiers that predict all classes.
